# Calendar Tracking App - Frontend

The **Calendar Tracking App** is a web-based tool designed to help organizations manage and track their communications with external companies. This React-based application enables users to log, view, and track communication tasks while ensuring timely follow-ups and consistent engagement. The backend API supports functionalities like managing companies, communication methods, and scheduling, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with these tasks.

## Features

### Admin Module
- **Company Management**: Allows admins to add, edit, or delete company details such as name, location, LinkedIn profile, contact emails, and phone numbers.
- **Communication Method Management**: Define and configure communication methods (e.g., LinkedIn Post, Email, Phone Call), including their sequence and whether they are mandatory in the communication cycle.

### User Module
- **Dashboard**: A grid view where users can quickly see the company name, last five communications, and the next scheduled communication with color-coded highlights.
- **Communication Logging**: Users can log new communications, specifying the type (e.g., LinkedIn Post, Email), date, and notes. This helps reset overdue or upcoming highlights for selected companies.
- **Interactive Features**: Hover effects on completed communications to display associated notes.
- **Notifications**: A dedicated notification section to display overdue communications and tasks due today.

### Calendar View
- View and manage past and upcoming communications in a calendar interface.
